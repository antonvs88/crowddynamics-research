# crowddynamics-research
Codes used in research in von Schantz & Ehtamo "Overtaking others in a spatial game of egress congestion". The repository includes code for simulation, data analysis and visual representation of data. The repository is based on my summer worker Jaan Tollander's codes https://github.com/jaantollander/crowddynamics, which where created when he was working as a research assistant in our research group in Aalto University School of Science, Department of Mathematics and Systems Analysis in summer 2016.

The folders in the repository includes:
* data_analysis contains the codes used for data analysis and producing the figures in the article von Schantz & Ehtamo "Overtaking others in a spatial game of egress congestion"
* model_with_game contains the codes for the simulation model with game.
* model_without_game contains the code for the simulation model without the game.
* model_with_fixed_strategies contains the simulation model, where there are different strategists and they are strategies are fixed, i.e., they do not play the game.

See the "readme.txt" file in each folder for instructions to use the codes.
